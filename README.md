File sorter sorts files in multiple cpecifiable ways, you can chose to sort files into and within specific folders by their datatype or a naming convention I have come up with, I will explain it with an example,

If i want a family photo called "photo.jpg" to go into "<current directory of the file>/photos/family/" I can call the image photos.family.photos.jpg and it will be automatically placed into the intended directory and creat it for you if the directory and associated files dont already exist.
