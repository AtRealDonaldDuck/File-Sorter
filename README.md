File sorter sorts files in a multitude of ways, you can chose to sort files into specific folders by their datatype or a specific naming convention.

Use Case Example:
If i want a "photo.jpg" to go into "<current directory>/photos/family/" I can call the image photos.family.photos.jpg and it will be automatically placed into the intended directory and creat it for you if the directory and associated files dont already exist.
